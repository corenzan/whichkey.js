**Whichkey** is a _work in progress_ of a javascript tiny toolkit to identify keystrokes coming from keydown and keyup events.

Examples:

```javascript
if (whichkey(event).escape) {...}
if (whichkey(event).backspace) {...}
if (whichkey(event).letter) {...}
if (whichkey(event).a) {...}
if (whichkey(event).arrow) {...}
if (whichkey(event).down) {...}
```
